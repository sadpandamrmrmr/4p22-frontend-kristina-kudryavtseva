        <h1>Hello World!</h1>
        <h2>Earth from space</h2>
        <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun in the solar system. The densest, fifth in diameter and mass among all the planets of the solar system and the largest among the terrestrial planets, which also includes Mercury, Venus and Mars. The only body currently known to man in the universe, inhabited by living organisms.</p>
        <h2>History of the Earth</h2>
        <p>The modern scientific hypothesis of the formation of the Earth and other planets of the solar system is the solar nebula hypothesis, according to which the solar system was formed from a large cloud of interstellar dust and gas. The cloud consisted mainly of hydrogen and helium, which were formed after the Big Bang, and heavier elements left behind by supernova explosions.</p>
